# Welcome To JSONMarkup from WebWorks

This is a simple bit of software that lets you create websites using JSON. It is not recomended for general use, but instead for code generation from software. So for example a website builder may use the syntax of JSONMarkup and then use this software to convert it to working HTML, CSS and JS.

# Notice

The point of this respository is not to share the code, the code is free to use and republish or do what you want with (read licence), but it's not meant for people to edit and make there own versions.

# Welcome To JSONMarkup from WebWorks

This is a simple bit of software that lets you create websites using JSON. It is not recomended for general use, but instead for code generation from software. So for example a website builder may use the syntax of JSONMarkup and then use this software to convert it to working HTML, CSS and JS.
